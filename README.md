### **Installation Guide**
1. Open Terminal / Command Prompt
2. Run these commands in terminal / command prompt: 
    - pip install tkinter
    - pip install matplotlib
    - from tkinter import messagebox

### **Disclaimer:**
If SimplEvents is not taking up your entire screen, the app may not look as intended
#### *example: MacOS dock not allowing SimplEvents to cover entire screen*
*fix: Go to System Preferences -> Dock and Menu Bar -> Check 'Automatically hide and show the dock'*

App looks better on Windows as MacOS has a tkinter issue where it does not allow for customization of buttons
