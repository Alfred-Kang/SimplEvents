# SimplEvents
###### *events made simple*
### **Developed by AlphaIncorporated**
Made with ❤️ by Alfred Kang, Laavanya Sundaravel, Lai Wan Lin using Python, Tkinter

### **Installation Guide**
1. Open Terminal / Command Prompt
2. Run these commands in terminal / command prompt(please make sure pip is installed on your device first): 
    - pip install tkinter
    - pip install matplotlib

### **Disclaimer:**
If SimplEvents is not taking up your entire screen, the app may not look as intended
#### *example: MacOS dock not allowing SimplEvents to cover entire screen*
*fix: Go to System Preferences -> Dock and Menu Bar -> Check 'Automatically hide and show the dock'*

App looks better on Windows as MacOS has a tkinter issue where it does not allow for customization of buttons

Currently, you are not able to switch between months, and are only allowed to set events for the current month
